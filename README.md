# Cyber_security_trends
Cybersecurity is an increasingly important concern in today's digital age, with cyberattacks becoming more frequent and sophisticated. This project aims to analyze cybersecurity trends and predict future threats using the Breach Level Index dataset from Kaggle.
Dataset and Background Information
The Breach Level Index dataset provides information on data breaches that have occurred worldwide since 2013. The dataset contains information on the number of records lost or stolen, the type of data compromised, the industry affected, and the source of the breach, among other variables.
By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the trends and patterns in cyberattacks, as well as identify the industries and types of data that are most vulnerable to breaches. We can also use predictive modeling techniques to forecast future threats and provide recommendations for improving cybersecurity measures.

Objectives and Deliverables

The objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Analyze the trends and patterns in cyberattacks over time.
2. Identify the industries and types of data that are most vulnerable to breaches.
3. Develop predictive models to forecast future threats.
4. Provide recommendations for improving cybersecurity measures.
The deliverables for this project include:
1. A report summarizing the findings of the analysis.
2. Data visualizations and graphs illustrating the trends and insights discovered.
3. Predictive models for forecasting future threats.
4. Recommendations for improving cybersecurity measures.
